          Asian Americans are the forgotten minority in the glass ceiling conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on an analysis of
          <a href = "https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/employment/jobpat-eeo1/">
         national EEOC workforce data</a>, I found that
          Asian American white-collar professionals are the least likely group
          to be promoted from individual contributor roles into management — less
          likely than any other race, including blacks and Hispanics. The analysis
          also found that white professionals are about twice as likely to be
          promoted into management as their Asian American counterparts.
