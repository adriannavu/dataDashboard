          Asian Americans are the forgotten minority in the glass ceiling conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          By analyzing
          <a href = "https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/employment/jobpat-eeo1/">
         national EEOC workforce data</a>, it can be concluded that
          Asian American white-collar professionals are the least likely group
          to be promoted from individual contributor roles into management — less
          likely than any other race, including blacks and Hispanics. White
          professionals are about twice as likely to be
          promoted into management as their Asian American counterparts.

          This data table summarizes the EEO-1 data as percentages for each race in the Executive and Professional categories.
          American Indians and Hawaiiwans have been excluded because their percentages were statistically negligable.
          By using this data, we can better understand the recruiting vs. promotion effects for Asians in the United States.
          It is easy to understand why Asian American representation in the workforce may not seem to be an issue.
          In some key measures, Asian Americans are the most successful U.S. demographic — more highly educated,
          for example, and with higher median incomes than any other racial group.
          More significant, Asian Americans are 13% of the professional workforce while making up only 5.6% of the U.S. population.
          However, Asians are only 6% of the executive workforce. Compared to their 13% share of professionals,
          Asians are not as successfully being promoted to the Executive level.
